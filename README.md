# Climate_change_Tensorflow_RNN

As part of the requirements for the completion of our Moringa School Data Science Course, We have data regarding climate change and its effects including natural disasters. We will analyze this data and attempt to classify and identify trends


<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

Global climate is projected to continue to change over this century and beyond. The magnitude of climate change beyond the next few decades depends primarily on the amount of 
heat-trapping gases emitted globally, and how sensitive the Earth’s climate is to those emissions.
Scientists say that even if we were to stop emitting greenhouse gasses completely, it is still expected that the average temperature will continue to rise.
The effects of climate change are More frequent and intense: droughts, storms, heat waves, rising sea levels, melting glaciers and warming oceans can directly harm animals,
destroy the places they live, and wreak havoc on people's livelihoods and communities. As climate change worsens, dangerous weather events are becoming more frequent or severe.

A changing climate is also affecting other aspects of crop production such as increased pests and disease in some situations, changes and even losses in biodiversity in some environments, and major disruptions due to extreme storm events, such as the recent decimation by Hurricane Maria of Puerto Rico’s agricultural crops, livestock, and associated infrastructure.

Problem Statement

Twitter being one of the most influential ways of passing information and analysing trends on various issues and in our case climate change, we chose to analyse tweets data to predict whether a tweet is pro-climate change, anti-climate change , from a news segment or just a neutral part with not take in climate change issues.

Metric for success

Implementing a model that can accurately predict whether a tweet lies in the following categories of sentiments:

1. Pro
2. Anti
3. News
4. Neutral

These categories are all in relation to climate change.

Data Source: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/edqian/twitter-climate-change-sentiment-dataset

Context

The dataset in its entirity is an extract from twitter and involves the message of climate change. In recent times there has been alot of talk aroud climate change and preseving our climate.

Data Relevance

The collection of this data was funded by a Canada Foundation for Innovation JELF Grant to Chris Bauch, University of Waterloo.

This dataset aggregates tweets pertaining to climate change collected between Apr 27, 2015 and Feb 21, 2018. In total, 43943 tweets were annotated. Each tweet is labelled independently by 3 reviewers. This dataset only contains tweets that all 3 reviewers agreed on (the rest were discarded).

Data set description

Each tweet is labelled as one of the following classes:

a) 2(News): the tweet links to factual news about climate change

b) 1(Pro): the tweet supports the belief of man-made climate change

c) 0(Neutral): the tweet neither supports nor refutes the belief of man-made climate change

d) -1(Anti): the tweet does not believe in man-made climate change

We came accross some very interesting facts.

Here's a snipet:
1. More people are into man-made Climate change

2. Those against man-made climate change are as a result of beliefs. 

3. The most popular hashtags are, broadly, climate and climatechange. Which is expected, given the topic; but also, among the top 3 are relating to trump and his campaign slogan maga.

<!-- USAGE EXAMPLES -->
## Usage

We did this analysis with the intention of identifying trends, causing factors and correlations within the tweets with the intention to inform public policy makers to make more informed decisions on police reforms
